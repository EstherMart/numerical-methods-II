# Numerical Methods II

This repository contains my implementations and experiments performed during the course of **Numerical Methods II**. Each report is organized in its own folder, containing the source codes, tests, and annotations.

The main language used is Java, but other languages such as C++ or Python may appear as the content of the course evolves.

## Goals

- Implement the algorithms studied in class
- Analyze results and validate numerical methods
- Explore different programming languages and paradigms

## How to Compile and Run
This repository includes a helper script `compiler.sh` to compile and run Java programs easily.
